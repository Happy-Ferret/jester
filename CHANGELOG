Version 1.2 (April 30th)
========================

  Release post:
  http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2007/4/30/jester-1-2-flexible-rest

  * Arguments to Base.model() now passed as a hash.  So:
      
      Base.model("User", {plural: "people", prefix: "http://www.thoughtbot.com"})
  
  * Initial support for figuring out a model's attributes on "build" by using /new.xml, a recent expansion to Rails' REST standard. (Changeset #6579)
  
      An HTTP request will not occur by default on a call to build(), supply a hash with the option "checkNew" set to true.  
      This action is also currently forced to be synchronous.  I expect this to change, but I need some feedback on syntax before that happens.
  
      For a discussion, see:
      http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/e36b84f9c1c3fe38
  
  * Asynchronous options can be provided as a hash, instead of simply providing an onComplete callback.
  
      Additionally, this is now the *third* argument to find, where query parameters are the second.
      You can use this hash and still force synchronous mode by specifying the "asynchronous" option as "false".
      
      User.find(1, {}, {onSuccess: successCallback, onFailure: failureCallback})
      
  * Additional query parameters to find(), taken as a second argument in hash form.  
  
      User.find("all", {admin: true, toys: 5}, {onSuccess: callback})
      => asynchronously requests "/users.xml?admin=true&toys"
      
  * Added (packed) date parsing code. (Nicholas Barthelemy)
  
  * If the response from a save() call includes an XML body, the model will be reloaded with that data.
  
  * Removed prototype.js from repository, included an optional, lightened version with only what Jester uses.
  
  * Packed ObjTree and included it in jester.js, eliminating ObjTree.js.
  
  * Little things:
      
      ID will be set on a find(id) call, even if the ID isn't in the returned XML response.
      Bug: ID wasn't being stored as a property correctly when it was parsed out of a Location header.
      Bug: One in ObjTree, where it didn't catch nodes with no text data in them (e.g. "<email></email>").
      Bug: Removed commas at the end of some hashes, which IE chokes on.
